aidef is a high-level programming language that compiles .aid specification files into code via AI.

.aid files use an nginx-like syntax with prose. This file (root.aid) is the specification for aidef itself.

include compiler.aid;
include runtime.aid;

environment {
  GEMINI_API_KEY is required for LLM calls during compilation and runtime.
}

cli {
  path=src/index.ts;
  
  Entry point for the aidef tool. Uses commander for arg parsing.
  
  Imports compile from the compiler module and run from the runtime module.
  
  Commands:
    compile [file] - compiles the given .aid file (default: root.aid) to the output directory
    run - executes a previously compiled plan from the output directory
    analyse - analyzes the plan and suggests improvements (not yet implemented)
    browse - TUI to inspect the plan (not yet implemented)

  Options:
    --output, -o sets the output directory (default: /tmp/aidef-<n>)
    --max-parallel limits concurrent LLM calls (default: 10)
    --max-retries for failed LLM calls (default: 3)
    --max-depth for compilation tree (default: 5)
}
