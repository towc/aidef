runtime {
  collects all the leaf nodes, and starts running them in parallel;
  keeps the user updated as it progresses;
  stores all ai calls made in ./runtime.log.jsonl;
  
  For each leaf, the runtime:
    1. Reads the .gen.aid.leaf.json file
    2. Runs any whitelisted commands in the leaf's `commands` array
    3. Generates files listed in the leaf's `files` array using AI
    4. All work happens within the leaf's folder context
}
