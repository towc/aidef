Start with the `rootAidPath` (e.g., `root.aid`).\n    2.  Recursively resolve all `include <path>;` statements:\n        -   If the path is a local `.aid` file, read its content and recursively process it.\n        -   If the path is an `https://` link, make a web request to fetch its content. Cache the result of web requests.\n        -   If the included file is a `.aid` file, process its content as `.aid`.\n        -   If the included file is *not* a `.aid` file (e.g., `.md`), escape any `#` characters that could be mistaken for comments (e.g., markdown headers) and encapsulate the content appropriately as prose within the resulting `.gen.aid` output.\n    3.  The tool must *never* modify the original human-written files.\n    4.  The final output should be a single, processed `.aid` string, which will be saved as `./node.gen.aid`. This output should be a flattened representation where all includes have been resolved.\n    5.  The output `.gen.aid` file should *not* contain any `include` statements.\n    ",
